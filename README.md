# Cirrhosis Liver Disease Prediction Project

Welcome to the Cirrhosis Liver Disease Prediction Project repository. This project aims to develop predictive models for determining the stage of cirrhosis liver disease using various algorithms, including KNN, decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes.

## Project Summary

### Phase 1

In Phase 1, we selected the cirrhosis prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is derived from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), conducted between 1974 and 1984. Cirrhosis is a condition affecting the liver due to various liver diseases, including hepatitis and chronic alcoholism.

- **Data Cleaning:** We initiated the project by cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and converting age data from days to years.

- **Data Visualization:** Various visualization techniques, such as bar plots and pie charts, were employed to gain insights into the distribution between variables and identify patterns.

- **Literature Review:** A brief literature review was conducted to understand cirrhosis disease-related research papers, articles, and literature.

### Phase 2

In Phase 2, we conducted further analysis, including preprocessing, feature selection, model fitting, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison.

## Conclusion

The well-organized methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, feature selection, model fitting, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison, is a key strength of this project.

**Key Findings:**
- Random forest and naive Bayes performed best in predicting the stage of cirrhosis liver disease.
- Limitations include the dataset's modest size and potential lack of relevance to contemporary medical procedures.

**Future Work:**
- Further investigation of sophisticated methods and algorithms may improve model performance.
- Additional analysis of results is needed to comprehend the algorithms' performance and identify causes of misclassifications.
